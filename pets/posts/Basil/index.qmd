title: Basil Montgomery
human: Lindsay Malloy, Associate Professor, Ontario Tech University
description: |
  Basil (pronounced "baz-uhl" the British way) Montgomery is very much loved and adored by his mom, dad, and older brother and sister (ages 5 and 7). We can barely remember our lives pre-Basil even though we have only had him about 2 months! Award winning puppy (February 2023 "Pawsitive Puppies Oshawa, ON" Best Trick Contest). 
quote: “Even softer and fluffier and cuter in real life! The original sad puppy dog eyes.”

categories: Cavalier King Charles Spaniel
age: "4 months"
talent: Ringing a service bell when we say "Service" and sometimes confusing it with a "Spin" or "Sit" command (he's learning!)
habit: Inhaling his entire meal in less than 30 seconds (not a single chewing sound to be heard) and barking at his own reflection in the fireplace
